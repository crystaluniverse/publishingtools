# Publishing tools
Publishing tools consist of multiple things a wiki and static websites server, ssh tunneling tools used for deployments mainly.

## install



- binaries on e.g. https://github.com/threebotserver/publishingtools/releases/tag/v1.0.0-alpha.4

## tfweb

`tfweb` is a wiki server/static websites server mainly built to drive the websites infrastructure for [threefold.io](https://threefold.io)

### Configurations

tfweb config is toml based, to provide more expressive configurations languages and less confusing switches/command line options.


#### Server config section
```toml
[server]
port = 3000
addr = "0.0.0.0"
```
Sets the binding `address` to `0.0.0.0` and the `port` to `3000`

#### Wiki config section

tfweb allows serving multiple wikis, with unique names. by specifying the `url` "the most common case" or the `path` on the filesystem, and the wiki source directory `srcdir`

- `title` title of the wiki (default: `name` value)
- `url` can be ssh url or https url
- `path` is the path of the top level root of the repository on the filesystem
- `srcdir` is where the wiki dir starts in the repository
- `branch` you can specify the branch to use
- `branchswitch` forces switching to `branch` if the one on the filesystem is different.
- `environment` enviroment name, if defined repos will be cloned under `~/tfweb/{environment}/`.

```toml
[[wiki]]
#unique name for the wiki
name = "sdk"
title = "SDK Wiki"
#http or git url
url = "github.com/threefoldfoundation/info_tfgridsdk"
#if empty will be auto created
path = ""
#commit automatically when there is new info, only works when ssh used
autocommit = false
#branch name, of "" then will be the default or what is found on the FS
branch = "development"
#switch branch automatically if the name given above and its different on FS
branchswitch = false
#path in the repo where the info is, std "src"
srcdir = "src"
#environment name (for example:  production, staging, testing)
environment = "production"
```

#### Website config section

```toml
#website
[[www]]
name = "freetft"
#http or git url
url = "git@github.com:threefoldfoundation/www_getfreetft.git"
#if empty will be auto created
path = ""
#commit automatically when there is new info, only works when ssh used
autocommit = false
#branch name, of "" then will be the default or what is found on the FS
branch = "development"
#switch branch automatically if the name given above and its different on FS
branchswitch = true
#path in the repo where the info is, std "src"
srcdir = ""
#environment name (for example:  production, staging, testing)
environment = "production"
```
the same as wiki, but in `[[www]]` array instead, used to serve static websites



#### Example configurations


```toml
[server]
port = 3000
addr = "0.0.0.0"

[[wiki]]
#unique name for the wiki
name = "sdk"
#http or git url
url = "github.com/threefoldfoundation/info_tfgridsdk"
#if empty will be auto created
path = ""
#commit automatically when there is new info, only works when ssh used
autocommit = false
#branch name, of "" then will be the default or what is found on the FS
branch = "development"
#switch branch automatically if the name given above and its different on FS
branchswitch = false
#path in the repo where the info is, std "src"
srcdir = "src"
#environment name (for example:  production, staging, testing)
environment = "production"

[[wiki]]
#unique name for the wiki
name = "wiki"
#http or git url
url = "https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/info_threefold"
#if empty will be auto created
path = ""
#commit automatically when there is new info, only works when ssh used
autocommit = false
#branch name, of "" then will be the default or what is found on the FS
branch = "development"
#switch branch automatically if the name given above and its different on FS
branchswitch = false
#path in the repo where the info is, std "src"
srcdir = "src"
#environment name (for example:  production, staging, testing)
environment = "production"

```

### Building


#### ubuntu machine setup

make sure you have the following `apt-get install -y build-essential curl libevent-dev libssl-dev libxml2-dev libyaml-dev libgmp-dev git`

building is as simple as `shards build` or `shards build --error-trace` to allow more error traces information


### Running

After building you will find the binary in `bin` directory and to run `./bin/tfweb -c CONFIG_PATH.toml`



## sshtool

`sshtool` allows you to expose a service running on a machine over other networks using ssh tunneling to be exposed over other machines.


### sshtool config

`sshtool` is toml driven, where each section is an element of array `[[sshconnections]]`
note: we are planning to have full compatibility with [tcprouter](https://gihtub.com/threefoldtech/tcprouter) too.

#### Single connection config

```toml
name = "host2_https"
ipaddr = "134.122.109.244"
# port for ssh connection
port = 22
# local port on our machine, where the server runs
localport = 443
# remote port
remoteport = 443
# user
user = "root"
tcprouter_secret = ""
```
- name: connection name
- ipaddr: machine address
- port: ssh port
- localport: local port on the machine where the server runs.
- remote port: remote port

typical use cases is `443 -> 443` for the case of https and `80 -> 80` for http

### running
`sshtool -c sshconnections.toml`

#### Example of production config

```toml
[[sshconnections]]
name = "host2_https"
ipaddr = "134.122.109.244"
# port for ssh connection
port = 22
# local port on our machine, where the server runs
localport = 443
# remote port
remoteport = 443
# user
user = "root"
tcprouter_secret = ""

[[sshconnections]]
name = "host3_https"
ipaddr = "104.248.250.78"
# port for ssh connection
port = 22
# local port on our machine, where the server runs
localport = 443
# remote port
remoteport = 443
# user
user = "root"
tcprouter_secret = ""

[[sshconnections]]
name = "host2_http"
ipaddr = "134.122.109.244"
# port for ssh connection
port = 22
# local port on our machine, where the server runs
localport = 80
# remote port
remoteport = 80
# user
user = "root"
tcprouter_secret = ""

[[sshconnections]]
name = "host3_http"
ipaddr = "104.248.250.78"
# port for ssh connection
port = 22
# local port on our machine, where the server runs
localport = 80
# remote port
remoteport = 80
# user
user = "root"
tcprouter_secret = ""

```
### sshd_config

make sure to `GatewayPorts yes` in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.

## Caddy Deployment


Create a config `Caddyfile` and fill in your websites.

```
to run execute `caddy` in the same directory of the `Caddyfile`

NOTE: Make sure that you have 80, 443 connections configured on the sshtool config file to be able to do http, https.


## Caddy development setup

in your hosts file
```
127.0.0.1 sdk.threefold.io
127.0.0.1 sdk3.threefold.io
127.0.0.1 wiki.threefold.io
127.0.0.1 wiki3.threefold.io
127.0.0.1 boardthreefold.me
127.0.0.1 advisors.threefold.me
127.0.0.1 ambassadors.threefold.me
```

and you can use [Caddyfiledev](./Caddyfiledev) by `caddy -conf Caddyfiledev`


## authentication
to protect wiki/websites with 3botconnect, you can define groups and attach these groups to a specific wiki or a website like the following

```
[[group]]
name = "admin"
users = ["ahmedthabet"]


[[wiki]]
name = "sdk"
title = "Grid Manual"
url = "github.com/threefoldfoundation/info_tfgridsdk"
path = ""
autocommit = false
branch = "development"
branchswitch = false
srcdir = "src"
environment = "production"
groups = ["admin"]
auth = true

[[wiki]]
name = "sdk2"
title = "Grid Manual Staging"
url = "github.com/threefoldfoundation/info_tfgridsdk"
path = ""
autocommit = false
branch = "development"
branchswitch = false
srcdir = "src"
environment = "testing"

```


- Here we define a group named `admin` and of users `ahmedthabet`
- We want to limit access to sdk to that admin group, so we need to define `groups = ["admin"]` and set `auth = true`
- in case of failed login attempts you will find the user who tried in `~/ftweb.access`


## Special endpoints

- `/:name/force_update` force updates a wiki to the latest upstream
- `/:name/merge_update` tries to merge upstream to local


## preparing static binaries

### alpine container

```
sudo docker run -it --name crystalalpine -h crystalalpine --privileged -v /opt/crystalalpine:/opt crystallang/crystal:0.34.0-alpine sh

```

### build binaries

to be executed from the alpine container
```
#!/bin/sh
## probably should add --release flag too
shards build --static --link-flags "$(pkg-config libxml-2.0 --libs --static)"

```

## Includes

You can include any markdown document from any wiki in other wikis, websites, or blogs.

**Syntax**:

```
!!!include:<wiki name>:<document name>
```

Also, inside current wiki, can be used as:

```
!!!include:<document name>
```

Examples:

In wikis or blogs:

```
!!!include:crystaltwin:news.md
```

In websites, markdown need to be rendered as HTML, for example, [markdown-element](https://github.com/mikeal/markdown-element) can be used:

Include the script:


```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/markdown-element/dist/markdown-element.min.js"></script>
```

Then use it with include as the following in any part of the page:

```
<mark-down>
!!!include:crystaltwin:funding
</mark-down>
```
